Exercise 4: Primitive quiz with Additional requirement
Since already have an understanding with the code flow, finished solo
learn certificate and also our in-class activities—I already knew what to
do for this activity. For this quiz I used while loops and else if
statements, for additonal functionality I chose to add message/feedback
that displays the user’s score at the end.

Exercise 5: Days of the month with Additional requirement
This is the activity I had a hard time with, well because this is where I
learned how to use dictionary that maps month numbers using 1-12 as
keys. It is like a dictionary within a dictionary, but it makes data
management easier (thus harder to code). This way, I can pay attention
to special cases such as February’s day in leap years. Again, more
coding using elif, error checking, and input handling.

Exercise 6: Brute force attack with Additional requirement
We did one in class similar to this, it’s parking fine. So, for this activity
I got practice using if-else statements because I used it to handle the
situation where its giving warning after a certain number of attempts. I
think I have gotten better at using conditions because this code can;
grant access is the input is correct, has only 5 attemps, and calls the
authority for 5th wrong attempt.

Exercise 7: Some Counting
Increments (i) and for loops, this one I have actually learned in solo
learn, but I think slicing method can also work on this activity. I’m
sharing this because learning alone and in class can have so much
difference but I could have not done it without the other.
Technically speaking, In this exercise I learn how to use loops in
various ways such as applying range function to define the starting and
ending points, along with increments whether its one or two. Practicing
both upwards and downwards, as well as specific slicing, stops or
interval; different types of counting as we call it—in a single code
really stretched my mind and my grasp about looping and number
manipulation


Exercise 8: Simple Search with Additional requirement
This is the most fun for me because I imagined it as like an online
invitation and it says “you’re not on the list” hence not invited. So, in
writing this code I learn to create this simple search program that
searches for specific string, those strings are names of boys within a list.
But then to make it realistic and additional functionality, I incorporated
user input; allowing it to accept any name rather than predefined values.
To check if the input name exist on the list, I used conditional
statements where it displays and gives a feedback for certain conditions.

Exercise 9: Hello
I remember learning the greeting function in solo learn, but upon
completing this activity, I realized that this was fill in the blanks. Here I
learned to recognize the importance of reusable function, and
structuring a python script to of course enhance to code modularity
while also understandable by incorporationg command line. 

Exercise 10: Is it even?
In this final activity, I learned how to create a program that checks
whether the number is even or odd. I have already learned it in class so
I just applied it here. So, I used modulus to determine if the number is
even, which of course if its divisible by two. By getting user input,
passing it to a function, and returning a feedback so the user get their
answer. Lastly, is to make sure everything works.
