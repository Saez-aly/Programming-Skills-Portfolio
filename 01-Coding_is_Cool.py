Exercise 1- Coding is cool
Direction: Fill in the blanks in the Python code below to output the phrase "Coding is Cool" to the console using variables and string concatenation.

"""

word1 = "Coding" #first word
word2 = "is"     #second word     
word3 = "cool"   #third word

#If we use this; print(word1+word2+word3) 
#This code concatenates the variables without spaces, which displays 'Codingiscool'. 
#However, the output should be 'Coding is cool'

print(word1+" "+word2+" "+word3) # This action adds spaces between the words, which displays 'Coding is Cool'.
